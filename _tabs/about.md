# Hi, I am Makider

I am a `cybersecurity enthusiast` who **absolutely loves** hacking and IT. I'm at my first year of Computer engineering in university and in my free time i like to *study* and *work* to improve my `skills`.

In this `space`, I will document the challenges I attempt and *solve*, the projects I *undertake*, and share some interesting `tips` and `tricks` that i learned along the way!

I also actively participate to ctfs almost every week with my team [ResetSec](https://ctftime.org/team/266022) <3 
preferred categories:
- web
- forensics
- pwn
- wannabe crypto guy :D
