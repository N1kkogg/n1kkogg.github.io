# Hi, I am Makider

I am a `cybersecurity enthusiast` who **absolutely loves** hacking and IT. At `18` years old, I have plenty of time to *study* and *work* to improve my `skills`.

In this `space`, I will document the challenges I attempt and *solve*, the projects I *undertake*, and share some interesting `tips` and `tricks` that i learned along the way!

```bash
makider@parrot~# wall 'have fun ^_^'
